\title{ Computes p-Values for The Comparison of Three or More Survival Curves at Fixed Points in Time }
\description{
This is an internal function and is not usually called by user. \cr
This function computes p-values for the comparison of three or more survival curves at fixed time points. 
}
\usage{
pvals.cat(pest, pval.test)
}

\arguments{
  \item{pest}{ a matrix of point estimates accompanied with confidence intervals at fixed time points }
  \item{pval.test}{ a type of a test used for the computation of p-values. Possible values are \dQuote{naive}, \dQuote{log},  \dQuote{loglog}. The default value is \dQuote{loglog}. }
}

\value{
a vector containing p-values for the comparison of the point estimates at fixed time points
